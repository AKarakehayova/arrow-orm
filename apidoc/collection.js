/**
 * @class Arrow.Collection
 * An Arrow Collection is an array of Arrow Model instances with some logic
 * to manipulate the models.
 *
 * To create a Collection, load the `arrow` module, then use the Collection constructor
 * to create an instance of a Collection. You can optionally pass in an array of Model instances
 * to initialize the collection.
 *
 *     var Arrow = require('arrow'),
 *         Collection = Arrow.Collection,
 *         myModels = new Collection([Model instances...]);
 *     ...
 *     var lastModel = myModels.slice(-1);
